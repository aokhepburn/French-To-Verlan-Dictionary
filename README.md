<h1 align="center"><b>Verlan Dictionary</b></h1>

## Introduction

Verlan is a French slang, and though we were able to find a website that had translations between standard French and Verlan we could not find one that included English translations. So we built a simple website with a JSON database that is attempting to provide English translations as well as standard French.

## Instructions

To run this project in your own local development environment follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
   - If you're working with HTTPS, use `git clone https://github.com/aokhepburn/French-To-Verlan-Dictionary.git`.
   - If you're working with SSH, use `git@github.com:aokhepburn/French-To-Verlan-Dictionary.git`.
2. Navigate to your `backend` subdirectory from the project root directory.
   - First, call `npm install` to install all referenced dependencies in our packaged files.
   - Next, run `npm start` to activate your backend.
3. With your backend now active, navigate to your frontend folder by traveling back to your root directory and back cd into `my-app`.
   - Again, install these dependencies with `npm install`.
   - Start your local server running with `npm start`.
4. Feel free to look around and learn some French slang!

## Future Features

- Adding speech to text to allow people to speak the slang to find the translation.
- Make a version of this site into a mobile app for practical travelling use!

## Contributions

Any features or recommendations or additions to translations are much appreciated!
